This project fine-tunes the IndicBERT model for Named Entity Recognition (NER) in Hindi and Malayalam and can be extended. It identifies entities like persons, locations, and organizations in text. The model can be trained on custom datasets and evaluated using standard NER metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
